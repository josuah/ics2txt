07:30	Welcome to FOSDEM 2019
07:55	Janson
	FOSDEM welcome and opening talk.

08:30	The State of Go
09:00	UD2.120 (Chavanne)
	Go 1.12 is planned to be released in February 2019 and this talk
	covers what's coming up with it.We'll talk about Go Modules, the
	proposals for Go 2, and all of the new things you might have missed.

09:30	HTTP/3
10:30	UD2.208 (Decroly)
	HTTP/3 is the next coming HTTP version. This time TCP is replaced by
	the new transport protocol QUIC and things are different yet again!

10:05	Minimalism matters
10:25	K.4.201
	Minimalism matters in computing. To trust systems we need to be able
	to understand them completely. Openssl heartbleed disaster was caused
	by code no longer being minimalistic, even if it is free and open
	source software. Hardware manfucturers and proprietary closed source
	solutions make things even worse with expectations of intrusion to
	privacy and backdoors if we don't aim for free hardware, software and
	minimalism. In this talk I will discuss minimalism in a broad context
	and narrow down on what the free software community can aim for.

07:55	Microkernel virtualization under one roof
08:30	AW1.121
	Today's off-the-shell virtualization solution is ridden with
	complexity. Application of virtualization call for trustworthy
	solutions. Complexity defeats trust.Microkernels with virtualization
	extensions and user-level VMMs on top are a approach to mitigate
	complexity. Modern microkernels like seL4, the NOVA microhypervisor,
	Genode's -hw- kernel or Fiasco.OC are such promising candidates.
	Fortunately and unfortunately, the diversity come with fragmentation
	of the small microkernel community. There are several VMMs for each
	platform tight to a specific microkernel, rendering it unusable
	across various kernels.Genode supports several kernels already, so
	that unification of virtualization interfaces for VMMs across kernels
	seem to come into reach. Does it ? The talk will cover the venture
	and current state of harmonization hardware-assisted virtualization
	interfaces to fit into the Genode OS framework.

14:40	FOSDEM infrastructure review
14:55	H.2215 (Ferrer)
	Informational and fun.

15:00	2019 - Fifty years of Unix and Linux advances
15:50	Janson
	2019 marks the fiftieth anniversary of Unix, but it is also the
	fiftieth anniversary of the ArpaNet/Internet, and people walking on
	the moon.  It marks the 50th anniversary of Woodstock, the beginning
	of America's LGBTQ movement at the Stonewall Inn in New York City,
	and maddog wrote his first program fifty years ago.  It was also in
	1969 that he shaved for the last time.2019 marks the 30th year of the
	World Wide Web, the 25th anniversary of V1.0 of the Linux kernel, and
	of many GNU/Linux distributions starting.  2019 also marks the
	twentieth anniversary of the Linux Professional Institute.All of
	these years, and anniversaries.....but why has Unix (and its younger
	offspring Linux) lasted so long?   What was different about Unix that
	caused it to survive and flourish?   Why is it important today, and
	how can we take it further?  How should we celebrate 2019?  While
	maddog does not have all the answers, he tries to make the answers he
	does have interesting and fun to know.

15:55	Closing FOSDEM 2019
16:00	Janson
	Some closing words.  Don't miss it!
