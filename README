NAME
     ics2txt â€“ convert ics file to simpler tsv or txt formats

SYNOPSIS
     ics2txt-tsv <file.ics >file.tsv
     ics2txt-ics <file.tsv >file.ics
     ics2txt-txt <file.tsv >file.txt
     ics2txt-back <file.txt >file.tsv

DESCRIPTION
     ics2txt is set of awk scripts to deal with iCal (.ics) format to publish,
     display and convert *.ics files, though a simple central TSV format.

     They all read from either stdin or the file passed as argument, and write
     to stdout.

     file.tsv files have one line per event, all with the following fields,
     separated by one tab:
      1. Begining (epoch)
      2. End (epoch)
      3. Category
      4. Location
      5. Summary
      6. Description

EXAMPLES
     Convert a calendar from HTTP .ics to custom .txt sorted by beginning:
           curl $url.ics | ics2txt-tsv | sort -n -k 1,1 | ics2txt-txt

     Convert a custom .txt format back to an .ics file and publish it:
           ics2txt-back cal.txt | ics2txt-ics | ssh www@$host 'cat
           >/var/www/cal.ics'

     Split an file according to the category, saved as .tsv:
           ics2txt-tsv cal.txt | awk -F '\t' '{ f = $3".tsv"; print >>f }'
