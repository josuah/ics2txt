TXT2ICS(1)                  General Commands Manual                 TXT2ICS(1)

NAME
     txt2ics  convert plain text to an ics file

SYNOPSIS
     txt2ics

DESCRIPTION
     txt2ics prompts the user for event information and print them in the
     iCalendar format.  If stdin is ont a TTY, it will not print the prompt
     string and act as a converter tool.

     It uses floating events: If it is 12:30, it will always be 12:30 of the
     country he resides in: if he moves to another time zone, it will be 12:30
     of this new time zone.  See this as the time zone where the event happen.
