NAME
     tical – convert ics file to simpler tsv or txt formats

SYNOPSIS
     ics2tsv <file.ics >file.tsv
     tsv2tcal <file.tsv >file.txt
     tcal2tsv <file.txt >file.tsv
     tsv2ics <file.tsv >file.ics

DESCRIPTION
     tical is set of awk scripts to deal with iCal (.ics) format to publish,
     display and convert *.ics files, though a simple central TSV format.

     They all read from either stdin or the file passed as argument, and write
     to stdout.

     file.tsv files have one line per event, all with the following fields,
     separated by one tab:
      1. Begining (epoch)
      2. End (epoch)
      3. Category
      4. Location
      5. Summary
      6. Description

EXAMPLES
     Convert a calendar from HTTP .ics to custom .txt sorted by beginning:
           curl $url.ics | tical-tsv | sort -n -k 1,1 | tcal-txt

     Convert a custom .txt format back to an .ics file and publish it:
           tical-back cal.txt | tcal-ics | ssh www@$host 'cat
           >/var/www/cal.ics'

     Split an file according to the category, saved as .tsv:
           tical-tsv cal.txt | awk -F '\t' '{ f = $3".tsv"; print >>f }'
